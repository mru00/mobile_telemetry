This is a telemetry module targeting RC cars. 

* Uses Bluetooth Smart (Bluetooth Low Energy) as transport
* Uses your mobile phone to display the data

It currently supports 

* Cell voltages (either through ADS1115 or nRF51-builtin ADCs)
* Total battery current (via http://www.dx.com/p/new-apm-osd-90a-voltage-current-sensor-connector-power-module-black-red-297400#.VrZpt99yuis, through ADS1115)
* Accelerometer (through ADXL345)

The hardware is currently just the modules hand-wired on a perfboard. No proper PCB is planned yet. Hardware is cheap stuff from dx.com.



The telemetry module is built around the nRF51 Soc. I used a BLE Nano (http://redbearlab.com/blenano/), it nicely combines a DCDC and the nRF51.

## Firmware for the SoC

The firmware source can be found in the `firmware` directory, a pre-built binary is available in `release/target.hex`.

## The Android app

The app source is available in the `app` directory. A pre-built binary is available in `release/Application-release-unsigned.apk`


## Hardware Variants

It is possible to run the telemetry model with different hardware configurations.

* Only cell voltages
 * Requires only the BLE Nano module

* Accelerometer ADXL345

* Cell current
 * Add the ADS1115 ADC

## Next steps


* make the app better
 * almost no error handling, no UX

* draw own pcb, 
 * current sensor
